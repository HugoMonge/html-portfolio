<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am Hugo Monge a 32 year old dad and engineer looking to grow and improve constantly in order to challenge myself and keep up with the fast moving pace world.

</p>


<p>Graduated on 2018 with a Bachelorette in Mechanical Engineering, I started working for a medical devices company in the process development and improvement fields. 
  With this I have learned skills like attention to detail, problem solving, multi-tasking and critical thinking.
  However before I finished my degree I was also playing around with the idea of being a programmer.
  And the first work experience I had was as a Quality Assurance technician for a small web page and application developer company. 
</p>

<p>That curiosity that was present in my earlier years has never left and I have been studying and trying to learn coding on my own.
  I love Python and think that it is an incredible tool, however I want to become a full stack developer and for that, focusing in HTML, CSS and JavaScrip is the best path to take.
  This is the first iteration of my Website, so if you are here since the beggining I welcome you and invite you to follow my progress.
